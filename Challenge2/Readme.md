1) I have created a powershell function to query the metadata of an instance within Azure. 
2) After importing the modules we can run the function.
3) Upon running the function it will ask for the data to be queried. 
    For example if we enter location, it will provide the location of the VM.
    For example if we enter name, it will return the name of the VM.
